#Bookmark Manager
_____________________

This was our project for Week 4 of Makers Academy. The task was to create a browser bookmark manager using Sinatra and PostgreSQL, in order to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags, save useful webpages, and browse links other users have added.

##Learning Objectives

To use a relational database to create persistent objects.

The website will have the following options:

* Show a list of links from the database
* Add new links
* Add tags to the links
* Filter links by a tag

## Technologies used:

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* HTML5
* CSS
* RSpec
* Capybara
* Cucumber
* DataMapper
* Postgres

## How to run tests:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/bookmark_manager.git
$ cd bookmark_manager
$ rspec
```

## How to run the server:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/bookmark_manager.git
$ cd bookmark_manager
$ bundle install
$ rackup
```

##Future intentions

I would like to use some CSS to style the front end.
